                    <p>In many states, new voting rules have made it more difficult for people to get to polling stations. These rules particularly affect people of color, people with disabilities, young people, elderly people, and women. Carpool Vote is a tool to fight back against an unfair political system in the 2018 elections and beyond.</p>

                    <p>We connect volunteer drivers with anybody who needs a ride - to the polls or voter I.D. office.</p>

                    <p>Please also sign up to join the campaign! We’re supported entirely by a network of volunteers who believe passionately that democracy is for everybody.</p>
                    <p>We have a variety of roles for people with any amount of time to give. This could involve joining our volunteer pool who take on small tasks that help the project take big leaps forward. If you're a web developer, then consider contributing to our website on <a href="https://github.com/voteamerica/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. We also have several strategic roles for those who want to remain actively involved until Election Day.</p>
                    <p>Please complete <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V7RHHNP" target="_blank">this quick questionnaire</a> if you'd like to get involved. We'll work with you to find the best fit on the project.</p>
                    <p>We also need funding to keep building the movement. Our volunteers are working around the clock but some things cannot be done with time and love alone. Could you spare some money to contribute to the campaign?</p>

    Mustache-style HTML template which is used in the AvailableTimes class in main.js to create rows in the first section of the two forms.

    Note that while this uses mustache-style template tags, we're actually not including Mustache/Handlebars, but instead we're just using String.prototype.replace() to populate them, because it works well enough and saves a few kilobytes.

    The raw/endraw Liquid tags are used to escape this section so that Jekyll doesn't confuse the Mustache-style tags with Liquid template tags and try to process them.
